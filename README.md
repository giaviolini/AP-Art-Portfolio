## Sustained Inquiry Questions
My sustained inquiry question was how do our fears grow with us but center around the feeling of the unknown. I wanted to touch upon the many fears I had growing up and noticed how they all centered around unknown things, so I decided to go more in-depth. 

For my first piece, I wanted to talk about the monsters hiding in my closet that I seemed to be afraid of.   \
For my second piece, I wanted to talk about the fears I had of my friends never caring about me.  \
For my third piece, I wanted to talk about the fears I had of growing up and leaving my childhood behind.  \
For my fourth piece, I wanted to talk about the fears I have of being creative and being overrun by AI.  \
For my fifth piece, I wanted to talk about the fears I have of the certainties with college.  \
For my sixth piece, I wanted to talk about the worries I had about achieving my dreams in the future.  \
And for my final piece, I wanted to talk about the fears I have of government censorship and how it affects people's perceptions.
